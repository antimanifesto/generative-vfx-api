- interaction design notes
	-the radical introduction of the mouse
	- introduced "navigation" to cyberspace
	- first kinetic human computer interface
	- doing + images = symbols (symbol as action-image)
enactive mentality: knowing where u are, manipulate objects
iconic: first level of symbolic thought, recognition, comparison
symbolic: higher level conceptual thinking, long chains of reason
DOING -- mouse - enactive
WITH IMAGES -- icons, windows - iconic
MAKES SYMBOLS -- smalltalk - symbolic
object oriented means the object knows what it can do
object.message (message being something it can understand)

-DESIGN MANIFESTO IN FAVOR OF PLAY
	-there is a crisis of natural interfaces, frank labels
	and straightforward instructions
	-conventional design as an obscuring of relations b/w
	user and interface in favor of a collapsing of self (flow)
	- the importance of states of unknowing, of possibility, has
	been greatly understated in design philosophy
	- instant understanding precludes experimentation modification and intervention
-LUDIC INTERFACES
	-ludic interfaces opposed to technically engineered interfaces (mouse)
	- jess kilby - center of the universe (rfid enabled tarot card table with blank rfid set of cards)
	-interface shapes experience, why then not make it cool as shit
	- technically engineered interfaces are ideological, they constrain possible interaction, 
	impose sets of rules
	- leaving the magic circle: assuming a trickster/spoilsport relation to the institution
	leaving and reentering is often an incredibly lucrative move for artists (emin's bed) but
	its success is 1. contingent on being inside the circle in the first place, and 2. being
	able to re-enter, not having strayed too far from the borders for too long
	
	- interpassivity: the induction of an observer state in the player within a text still parsable
	as interactive
	- "ZERO INTERFACE"
